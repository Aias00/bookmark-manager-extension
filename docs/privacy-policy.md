# Privacy Policy for Bookmark Manager

Last updated: February 25, 2026

Bookmark Manager is a Chrome extension for scanning and organizing browser bookmarks.

## What data is processed
- Bookmark metadata available from the Chrome Bookmarks API (title, URL, folder structure, and bookmark IDs).
- Extension settings (such as scan concurrency and timeout).
- Scan results (invalid link status and related diagnostic info).

## How data is used
- To scan bookmark links and classify failures.
- To support user-requested actions such as retry, delete, duplicate cleanup, and organize-by-domain.
- To persist local settings and last scan state for user convenience.

## Data sharing
- We do not collect, transmit, sell, or share your personal data to developer-controlled external servers.
- Link checks send network requests directly from your browser to the bookmark URLs you choose to scan.

## Storage
- Data is stored locally in Chrome extension storage (`chrome.storage.local` / `chrome.storage.sync`).

## Third-party services
- The extension does not integrate with third-party analytics or advertising SDKs.

## Contact
If you have privacy questions, provide a support contact in your Chrome Web Store listing.
